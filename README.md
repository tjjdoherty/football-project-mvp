# football-project-mvp
MVP for a football prediction engine using data from 2008-2016.

General goals of this project include:
- Exploration of the Random Forest Classifier algorithm for an unsolved prediction problem (would we watch sport if it was *entirely* predictable?)
- Many opportunities to explore data visualisation tools. The source data has x and y coordinates of players' pitch positions and many minor match events that are quantifiable.
- Analysis of betting odds offered historically & viewing changing performance over time.

# Summary (more to follow)
MVP produced a football (soccer) match prediction model based on 2008-2016 Premier League matches
- See Intro_clean_EDA for introduction and data exploration with extensive commentary
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers for predicting results of matches
  
# **Jan 2025 Update**:

This is one of the two 'premier' projects I will be building out to illustrate my skillset. There are opportunities for unsupervised learning, pipeline building for the data preprocessing, other MLOps and other directions the data storytelling can go in.

# Future goals (more to follow):
- Use match data eg. shots, fouls, possession, average player positions to evaluate changes in football style & philosophy (e.g. short passing intensive Tiki Taka emerging 2008 onwards)
- The original database in SQL has betting odds from across a number of bookmakers. Explore the accuracy and performance of these over time.
